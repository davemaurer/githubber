##### [Dave Maurer](https://github.com/davemaurer)

Githubber is a clone of the github site with limited functionality. It is a solo project focused on consuming and manipulating API data. Built from scratch.

[Project Outline](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md#technical-expectations) | [Heroku](http://git-hubber.herokuapp.com), while it's up.

Instructions:

Github

Build a basic version of the Github profile / feed UI. As a user, I should be able to:

Authenticate with my github account
View basic information about my account (profile pic, number of starred repos, followers, following)
View contribution summary information (Contributions in last year, longest streak, current streak)
View a summary feed of my recent activity (recent commits)
View a summary feed of recent activity from users whom I follow
View a list of organizations I'm a member of
View a list of my repositories
Extensions:

View a list of open pull requests that I have opened
View a list of "@mentions" that I was included in
Create a new repository
